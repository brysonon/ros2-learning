## Jan 21, 2026 — ROS 2 on Windows 10 (Pub/Sub + GitHub)

### ✅ What I accomplished
- Installed ROS 2 on Windows 10 using **Pixi** + the **Windows binary**
- Learned how terminal “setup scripts” work (`local_setup.bat`)
- Created my first ROS 2 workspace + package
- Built and ran my own **publisher/subscriber** nodes (topic-based communication)
- Set up **VS Code** as my main editor
- Created a GitHub repo to document everything I’m learning

---

### 🧠 Key concepts I learned (ROS 2 basics)
**Workspace (`ros2_ws`)**
- A folder that holds ROS packages and build outputs

**Package (`my_first_pkg`)**
- A ROS project that contains nodes + config files that ROS can recognize and run

**Node**
- A running program in ROS (publisher node, subscriber node, etc.)

**Topic**
- A named channel where messages flow (example: `/chatter`)

**Publisher**
- Sends messages to a topic

**Subscriber**
- Receives messages from a topic
