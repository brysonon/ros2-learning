## 2026-01-29 — ROS 2 Actions

Today I learned how **ROS 2 actions** work and successfully ran an **action server and action client**.

### Key Takeaways
- Actions are used for long-running tasks that need **feedback**, **cancellation**, and a **final result**
- The **action server** performs the task and publishes feedback
- The **action client** sends a goal and receives feedback and the final result

I implemented and tested a Fibonacci action to understand the workflow.

### Running the Action (Two-Terminal Setup)

**Terminal 1 — Action Server**
```bat
cd C:\pixi_ws\ros2_ws
call install\setup.bat
ros2 run my_first_pkg fibonacci_action_server
```

**Terminal 2 — Action Client**
```bat
cd C:\pixi_ws\ros2_ws
call install\setup.bat
ros2 action send_goal /fibonacci example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci "{order: 10}"
```


Notes
Every new terminal must be sourced with install\setup.bat before using ros2

Actions will be used in my Fetch / Overcooked project to represent robot tasks like navigation, pick-up, and coordination with a human
