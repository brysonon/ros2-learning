## Yesterday — ROS 2 Launch + GitHub

### ✅ What I did
- Built my first working ROS 2 **publisher/subscriber** package (`my_first_pkg`)
- Confirmed both nodes connect on `/chatter` (publisher count = 1, subscription count = 1)
- Created a **launch file** so I can run both nodes with one command:
```bat
ros2 launch my_first_pkg pubsub.launch.py

- Rebuilding and rerunning: 
colcon build --packages-select my_first_pkg --symlink-install
call install\local_setup.bat
ros2 launch my_first_pkg pubsub.launch.py

Installing ROS2 and workspace packages into workspace folder (run once per terminal session):
cd C:\pixi_ws\ros2_ws
call install\setup.bat

Then, run commands.
